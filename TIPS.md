Tips from Spike

1) In Transaction - don't format the items as they are    created. Use private methods to format each item that is stored.

2) Try mocking Date as it is made into a new transaction. Don't pass it in as an argument.
in the feature test - for example no Date as argument.

3)  Calculate the balance dynamically
